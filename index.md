## Welcome to James' Page
This page contains my projects and work see my [github](https://github.com/jho9). There is nothing special here at the moment but I will be populating this page!

### Current Projects


For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jho9/jho9.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
